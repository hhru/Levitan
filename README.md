## Requirements
- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+


## Installation
### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate Levitan into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager,
add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:
``` swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/almazrafi/Levitan.git", from: "1.0.0")
```
and then specify `"Levitan"` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use Levitan.

Here's an example `Package.swift`:
``` swift
// swift-tools-version:5.9
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    products: [
        .library(name: "MyPackage", targets: ["MyPackage"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/almazrafi/Levitan.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyPackage", dependencies: ["Levitan"])
    ]
)
```

### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:
``` bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Levitan into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:
``` ogdl
github "almazrafi/Levitan" ~> 1.0.0
```

Finally run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Levitan.framework` into your Xcode project.

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
``` bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Levitan into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), specify it in your `Podfile`:
``` ruby
platform :ios, '14.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Levitan'
end
```

Finally run the following command:
``` bash
$ pod install
```
